# 🏏 T20I Cricket Performance Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built using **real-world T20I batting data scraped from ESPN Cricinfo**.  
The goal is to transform raw, unstructured sports data into **clear, insight-driven visual analytics**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Cricket data available online is often:
- Unstructured and inconsistent  
- Not analysis-ready  
- Difficult to interpret at scale  

In this project, I used a **web-scraped dataset from my Python project** and converted it into a **business-ready Power BI dashboard** to analyze **player-wise and country-wise T20I batting performance**.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- **Total Runs, Matches, Strike Rate & Batting Average KPIs**
- **Player-wise performance comparison**
- **Country-wise total runs analysis**
- **Century & Half-Century distribution**
- **Strike Rate comparison (Players × Countries)**
- **Trend analysis with interactive slicers**

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- Interactive slicers:
  - Year
  - Player Name
  - Country
- KPI cards for quick insights
- Clean and minimal dashboard layout
- End-to-end flow:
  **Web Scraping → Data Cleaning → Power BI Visualization**

---

## 📈 Business & Analytical Insights

- India leads in total T20I runs
- Matches played strongly correlate with total runs
- Players score more 50s compared to 100s
- High strike rate players deliver impactful performances
- Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jos Buttler, and Paul Stirling consistently stand out

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI**
- **Power Query**
- **DAX (Basic KPIs)**
- **Python (for data scraping & preprocessing)**
- **BeautifulSoup & Requests** (in the data collection phase)

---

## 📂 Dataset Source

The dataset used in this dashboard was **scraped from ESPN Cricinfo** as part of my earlier **T20I Web Scraping & Analysis project** using Python.
